        <h1>June 6th</h1>
        <p>So I had an interesting dream last night. It might have stemmed from the fact that my school's cheer team seems to be getting 2 male cheerleaders this upcoming year, I haven't confirmed it but it looks like it's happening as seen on a tweet (there
            was a male cheerleader last year for the first time in like 13 years, but he was probably falsely expelled for using drugs that he probably didn't use).<br><br>I was in the school and saw 2 other male cheerleaders, one seemed to be a kid with
            special needs (autism or something). I was inspired when I saw this Asian girl do back flips to reach the top of a fire extinguisher mount (one of the back flips required her to jump to get to it). Then she tweaked a bit I guess. I was inspired
            and I was like "I want to do that". This was the first day of school and I was a senior, by the way (true in real life).<br><br>I also saw these cheer members with names I'm not familiar with, like "line" or "backup". No idea what they meant<br><br>OK,
            now that I had an inspiration, I went to the place I went to Taekwondo at, but quit 12 years ago because my sister was born and we needed a hiatus that turned out to be permanent. It was terrible, and I hated it. It was like practice for dance
            moves or something? It was on a hard gym floor as opposed to the soft mat floor that I remember we had when I was there.<br></p>
